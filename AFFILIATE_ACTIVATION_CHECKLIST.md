# Affiliate Activation Checklist — LionGate Travels

This checklist defines the **only approved path** to activate affiliate links for the LionGate Travels MVP.
Follow each step in order. Do not skip steps.

---

## Preconditions (ALL must be true)

- [ ] Affiliate account approved (Awin + Booking.com)
- [ ] Approval email received and saved
- [ ] README.md, CHANGELOG.md, SECURITY.md are committed and live
- [ ] MVP scope remains locked (no new features)
- [ ] You explicitly decide to activate **Hotels only** (Partner B)

If any box above is unchecked, **do not proceed**.

---

## Activation Scope (Locked)

**Activate:**
- Partner B — Hotels & Accommodation (Booking.com affiliate link)

**Do NOT activate:**
- Flights
- Packages
- Cars
- Insurance
- Multiple partners
- Comparisons
- Pricing displays

---

## One-Change Rule

Only **one change** is permitted during activation:

- Replace the stubbed Partner B redirect with a real Booking.com affiliate URL

No other files, text, UI, or logic may change.

---

## Link Setup

- Use a Booking.com affiliate deep link to hotel search
- Include your unique affiliate tracking ID
- Do not cloak or shorten links
- Do not add scripts or cookies you manage

---

## User Experience Verification (Required)

After activation, personally test:

- [ ] Partner B selection works
- [ ] Disclosure appears before redirect
- [ ] “Continue” redirects correctly
- [ ] Booking.com loads successfully
- [ ] No errors or warnings appear
- [ ] The flow feels honest and non-deceptive

If anything feels unclear or misleading, **rollback immediately**.

---

## Rollback Procedure (Instant)

If needed:
- Remove or disable the affiliate URL
- Restore the previous stubbed behavior
- Commit and push

Rollback must take **minutes**, not hours.

---

## Post-Activation Rules

- Do not market aggressively
- Do not add analytics yet
- Do not change copy
- Do not add more affiliates
- Observe operational readiness only

---

## Expansion (Not Active)

Future steps require explicit approval and documentation updates:
- Additional hotel partners
- Flights
- Analytics
- Custom domain
