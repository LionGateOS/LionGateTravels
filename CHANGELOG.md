## [MVP v1] — Live

**Status:** Released  
**Deployment:** GitHub Pages  
**Scope:** Locked

### Overview
LionGate Travels MVP v1 establishes the foundational platform for a neutral, partner-based travel discovery experience.  
This release focuses on clarity, compliance, and future monetization readiness without enabling direct transactions.

### Included
- Publicly accessible MVP (static, front-end only)
- Clear third-party responsibility disclosures
- Partner handoff flow (stubbed / affiliate-ready)
- Accessibility-aware, mobile-first UI
- No user accounts or authentication
- No checkout, payments, or bookings
- No backend services

### Monetization Status
- Affiliate model: **Planned**
- Active affiliate links: **None**
- Partner approval: **Pending / Optional**
- Revenue generation: **Disabled by default**

### Governance Notes
- MVP scope is frozen
- No scope expansion without explicit authorization
- Monetization activation requires deliberate opt-in
- Platform remains non-seller and non-agent

## Planned (Post-MVP, Not Active)

The following items are **not active** and require explicit approval before implementation:

- Affiliate link activation (e.g., hotels)
- Additional partner categories (e.g., flights)
- Custom domain configuration
- Analytics (privacy-respecting, minimal)
- UI refinements based on validated feedback
