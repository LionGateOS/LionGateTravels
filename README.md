# LionGate Travels — MVP

**LionGate Travels** is a neutral travel discovery platform designed to help users explore travel options and then continue their journey on trusted third‑party booking partners.  
This repository contains the **locked MVP implementation** of LionGate Travels, deployed publicly via GitHub Pages.

---

## What LionGate Travels Is

LionGate Travels is:

- A **discovery and referral platform**
- A **neutral interface** that does not sell travel
- A **partner‑based handoff system** for hotels and travel services
- A **front‑end–only MVP** with no backend dependencies

The platform is intentionally simple and transparent. Users are informed when they are leaving LionGate Travels and completing bookings on third‑party websites.

---

## What LionGate Travels Is NOT

LionGate Travels is **not**:

- A booking engine
- A travel agency
- A payment processor
- A seller of flights, hotels, or packages
- A data‑collection or user‑account system

All pricing, availability, payments, refunds, and policies are handled **solely by third‑party partners**.

---

## MVP Scope (LOCKED)

The current MVP includes:

- Publicly accessible website (GitHub Pages)
- Clear third‑party responsibility disclosures
- Partner selection UI (stubbed or affiliate‑ready)
- Accessibility‑aware, mobile‑first interface
- No user authentication
- No checkout or payment flow
- No backend services

The MVP scope is **locked**. New features or integrations are intentionally deferred until after validation and partner approval.

---

## Partner & Affiliate Model

LionGate Travels is designed to support **affiliate‑based monetization**.

### Current State
- Partner buttons may be stubbed or informational
- No affiliate links are active until explicitly enabled
- No revenue is generated by default

### Intended Model
When activated, LionGate Travels may:
- Redirect users to approved third‑party booking partners (e.g., hotels)
- Earn commissions via affiliate programs
- Remain non‑transactional and non‑custodial

The platform does **not**:
- Control partner pricing
- Influence availability
- Interfere with partner policies

This structure is intentional to preserve neutrality, compliance, and user trust.

---

LionGate Travels MVP is deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

- Branch: `main`

## Status

- Transparency
