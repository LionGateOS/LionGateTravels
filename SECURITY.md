# Security Policy — LionGate Travels

LionGate Travels follows a **minimal, non-custodial security posture** appropriate for a static, front-end–only MVP.

This document explains what security means for this project and how to report concerns responsibly.

---

## Scope

LionGate Travels MVP is:

- A **static website**
- Deployed via **GitHub Pages**
- **Front-end only**
- No backend servers
- No databases
- No APIs requiring authentication

As such, the security scope is intentionally limited.

---

## Data Handling

LionGate Travels:

- Does **not** collect personal user data
- Does **not** store user accounts
- Does **not** process payments
- Does **not** handle bookings
- Does **not** store cookies beyond standard platform behavior

All transactions, payments, and user data handling occur **solely on third-party partner websites** after redirection.

---

## Payments & Financial Data

LionGate Travels:

- Is **not** a payment processor
- Does **not** collect credit card or banking information
- Does **not** intermediate or escrow funds

Any financial activity is governed entirely by third-party partners.

---

## Affiliate & Third-Party Links

LionGate Travels may include outbound links to third-party partners.

- Third-party sites operate under their own security policies
- LionGate Travels does not control partner infrastructure
- Users are informed when leaving the LionGate Travels site

---

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you believe you have discovered a security issue related to LionGate Travels:

- Please open a **GitHub Issue** with the label `security`
- Or contact the project maintainer via GitHub

Do **not** publicly disclose security concerns before allowing reasonable time for review.

---

## Limitations

Because this project is static and non-custodial:

- There is no account takeover risk
- There is no stored data breach risk
- There is no payment compromise risk

Security concerns are therefore limited to:
- Content integrity
- Link correctness
- Deployment configuration
